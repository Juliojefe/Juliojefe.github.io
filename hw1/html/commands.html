        <p>
          In the demonstration that I provided we got to see several of steghides commands in action.Steghide however 
          is not limited to those commands and functionalities. For example we did not see that steghide has a command to 
          display all of the encryption algorithms that they support. As you can see below they support many different 
          encryption algorithms all which can be chosen with a different command.

          In the previous example we could have chosen to encode using any of these encryption methods. To select which encryption -e
          followed by our choice would have been used. We could have also chosen to hide the embed files name by using -N. Quickly I
          will show those two in action by running the following command.
        </p>
        <pre class="terminal"><code>
          <span class="prompt">┌──(Julio㉿DESKTOP-STHA33J)-[/mnt/c/Users/Julio/Pictures/steghide_example]</span>
          <span class="prompt">└─$ <span class="command">steghide embed -cf ferrari.jpg -ef sample-data.csv -sf steg_ferrari2.jpg -p mysecretpass -e "blowfish cbc" -N</span></span>
          <span class="output">embedding "sample-data.csv" in "ferrari.jpg"... done</span>
          <span class="output">writing stego file "steg_ferrari2.jpg"... done</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          I have created a new file by the name of steg_ferrari2.jpg which is distinct and separate from the steg_ferrari.jpg 
          from the previous demonstration. I also used -N so that the name of the embedded file is kept secret and I used -e to 
          set the encryption method to blowfish cbc. This is what all three files look like side by side. Visually they are  indistinguishable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then by using the info command and entering in the correct passphrase we can see that the name of the hidden file is
          not given to us and that blowfish cbc encryption was used.

          These are a few more commands and there are many more to explore. Funny enough you can actually learn about more
          commands by running the “man steghide” command. By reading through this documentation you can learn about commands
          that allow you to choose between compressing or not as well as at what compression level to embed your files. You 
          can also read more directly on their github<sup id="ref-1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[1]</a></sup>.
