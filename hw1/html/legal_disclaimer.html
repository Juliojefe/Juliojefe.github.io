          The covered content includes information and hands on examples of steghide, a steganography tool. This content is 
          intended strictly for educational purposes. The content educates by providing a safe environment for learning about 
          cyber security. The intention of this content is not to harm and is simply to spread awareness.  The examples are made up 
          and  tested in a way that doesn’t break any laws. Laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030)
          <sup id="ref-1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[1]</a></sup>
          allows 
          research that doesn’t cause damage. Furthermore the First Amendment
          <sup id="ref-2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[2]</a></sup>
          protects this type of content  California’s 
          Education Code (Sections 94367 and 94368)
          <sup id="ref-3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-3" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[3]</a></sup>
          also supports learning projects like this, so this work isn’t illegal or harmful. 
          I am not encouraging anything against the law, and this is just for education.

          I who created this content are not responsible if someone uses it the wrong way. If you want to use these tools outside 
          this assignment, talk to a lawyer first to stay safe. By reading or using this, you agree it’s not meant to hurt anyone or 
          break laws, and any problems from using it on your own are your responsibility. This is meant for learning only, not for anything 
          bad or illegal.
